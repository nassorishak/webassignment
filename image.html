             Coffee is a popular beverage made from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of the Coffea plant.
             It is typically brewed by steeping the ground coffee beans in hot water, and it can be consumed hot or cold,
             with or without added milk, cream, sugar, or flavorings.
             Coffee contains caffeine, a natural stimulant that can help to increase alertness and reduce fatigue.
             It also contains antioxidants, which can help to protect the body against damage from harmful molecules called free radicals.
             Some studies have suggested that regular coffee consumption may have health benefits,
             such as reducing the risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, liver disease, and some types of cancer.
             However, excessive consumption of coffee can have negative effects on health, such as insomnia, anxiety, and digestive problems.
             It is recommended that adults consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is roughly equivalent to four cups of brewed coffee.
             Pregnant women, children, and people with certain health conditions should consume less or avoid caffeine altogether.
